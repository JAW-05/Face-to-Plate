#🍽️ Face-to-Plate

Face-to-Plate is an AI-powered food recommendation system that suggests suitable meals based on the user’s age, gender, and emotional expression detected through a webcam photo.

It leverages OpenVINO™ for efficient real-time model inference and was developed as part of my Entrepreneurship project for the Higher Nitec in AI Applications course at ITE College West.
