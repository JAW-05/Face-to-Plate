# 🍽️ Face-to-Plate
Face-to-Plate is an AI-powered food recommendation system that suggests suitable meals based on the user’s age, gender, and emotional expression detected from a webcam photo.
It leverages OpenVINO™ for efficient AI model inference and was developed for my Entrepreneurship project under the Higher Nitec in AI Applications course at ITE College West.
